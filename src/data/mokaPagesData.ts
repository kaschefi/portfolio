    overview:
      "MoKa is a local-first, embodied robotic AI assistant engineered on top of the Anki Cozmo hardware platform. It eliminates cloud dependencies by pairing an ultra-low-latency semantic reflex arc (~45ms P50) with an asynchronous, graph-compiled cognitive deliberator powered by Ollama Small Language Models (SLMs) and on-device neural synthesis.",
    description:
      "Embodied conversational agents face a fundamental architectural dichotomy: physical hardware demands instantaneous, deterministic reaction times (<50ms) to ensure stability and user responsiveness, whereas open-domain linguistic reasoning and dynamic tool execution traditionally impose massive computational latency (1,000ms - 3,000ms) and cloud API coupling.\n\n" +
      "MoKa resolves this latency-versatility dilemma through a dual-plane hybrid cognitive architecture:\n\n" +
      "1. The Spinal Reflex Plane (Tier 1): Implemented in pure on-device C++ and Python bindings via FastEmbed (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 384D embeddings) and the semantic-router framework. Utterances matching physical actuation, safety stops, or local OS workstation setups are resolved in ~45ms without allocating a single LLM token.\n\n" +
      "2. The Cognitive Cortical Plane (Tier 2): Complex natural language queries, multi-step tool calls, and stateful memory reasoning route into a compiled LangGraph state machine. This plane runs entirely on local quantization substrates (Ollama qwen2.5:3b for routing/synthesis, ornith:9b for isolated code sandboxing, and Kokoro-v1.0 ONNX for zero-disk streaming TTS).\n\n" +
      "3. Hardware-Software Decoupling: The cognitive substrate interfaces with physical actuators via a 33Hz low-level PyCozmo packet loop, safeguarded by asynchronous monkey-patched motor interrupters that guarantee physical stability even during heavy GPU/CPU tensor loads.",
